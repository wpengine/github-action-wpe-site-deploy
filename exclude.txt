# NOTE: 
#    WP Engine does not support server side versioning so hosting any version control
#    on the server would not be advantageous.

# WordPress specific files
# NOTE:
#     These files are excluded from the deploy so as to prevent unwanted errors from occurring, 
#     such as accidentally deploying a local version of wp-config.php or accidentally deleting
#     wp-content/uploads/ if a --delete flag is passed while deploying root. Most paths here 
#     are ingnored in the WPE sample .gitignore per best practice.

# WP Engine specific files
# NOTE:
#   These files are specific to running a WordPress site at WP Engine and would
#   likely result in a broken production site if modified in production (in
#   fact, permissions would prevent modification for many of these files). While
#   some of these files (such as those in /_wpeprivate) would be extremely large
#   and completely useless in the context of local WordPress development, others
#   (such as some of the WP Engine managed plugins) might be useful in rare
#   circumstances to have as a reference for debugging purposes.
