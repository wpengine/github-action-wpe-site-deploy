# Development

## Getting Started

Before you get started, we recommend installing [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to help manage `node` and `npm` versions. Next, from your local copy of the action run `nvm use` and `npm install`. You're ready to start coding!

## Git Workflows

We use the [feature branch workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow). The workflow for a typical code change looks like this:

1. Create a new branch for the feature.
2. Make changes to the code.
3. Use `npx changeset` to create a changeset describing the change to users.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. Once all checks are passing and the PR is approved, Squash and Merge into the `main` branch.

## Updating the Docker Image

The docker image that this action relies on is managed in https://github.com/wpengine/site-deploy. After a new `wpengine/site-deploy` image is released and tagged:

1. Create a new branch.
2. Update the tag in [./action.yml](./action.yml).
3. Use `npx changeset` to create a changeset describing the change to users.
4. Commit your changes.
5. Open a pull request to the `main` branch.
6. Once all checks are passing and the PR is approved, Squash and Merge into the `main` branch.

## Creating a release

We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to automate versioning and releasing.

1. Go to pull requests and view the automated "Version Action" PR.
2. Review the PR:
    - [ ] Changelog entries were created.
    - [ ] Version number in package.json was bumped.
    - [ ] All `.changeset/*.md` files were removed.
3. Approve, then "Squash and merge" the PR into `main`.

Merging the versioning PR will run a workflow that creates or updates all necessary tags. It will also create a new release in GitHub.
