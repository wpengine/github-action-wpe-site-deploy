# GitHub Action for WP Engine Site Deployments

This GitHub Action can be used to deploy your WordPress repo/branch from Github to a WP Engine environment (Production / Stage / Dev) via the WP Engine SSH Gateway toolkit and a prefashioned rsync protocol. Deploy a theme, plugin or other directory with the TPO options. Post deploy, this action will automatically purge your WP Engine cache to ensure all changes are visible. 

## Example GitHub Action workflow

1. Create a `.github/workflows/main.yml` file in your root of your WordPress project/repo, if one doesn't exist already.

2. Add the following to the `main.yml` file, replacing WPE_PRODUCTION_ENV, WPE_STAGING_ENV, WPE_DEVELOPMENT_ENV and the public and private key var names and branches if they were anything other than what is below. Consult "Furthur Reading" on how to setup keys in repo Secrets.

3. Git push your site repo. 

```
name: Deploy to WP Engine
on:
  push:
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
    steps: 
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: GitHub Action Deploy to WP Engine
      uses: wpengine/github-action-wpe-site-deploy@feature/stage
      env:
        WPE_SSHG_KEY_PRIVATE: ${{ secrets.WPENGINE_SSH_KEY_PRIVATE }} 
        PHP_LINT: true
        TPO_SRC_PATH: ""
        TPO_PATH: ""
      # Branches & Environments 
        PRD_BRANCH: main
        PRD_ENV: prodsitehere
        STG_BRANCH: stage
        STG_ENV: stagesitehere
        DEV_BRANCH: dev
        DEV_ENV: devsitehere
```

## Setting up your SSH keys for repo

1. [Generate a new SSH key pair](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/) as a special deploy key between your Github Repo and WP Engine. The simplest method is to generate a key pair with a blank passphrase, which creates an unencrypted private key. 

2. Store your public and private keys in the GitHub repository of your website as new 'Secrets' (under your repository settings) using the names `PRIVATE_KEY_NAME` and `PUBLIC_KEY_NAME` respectively with the name in your specfic files. These can be customized, just remember to change the var in the yml file to call them correctly. 

3. Add the Public SSH key to your WP Engine SSH Gateway configuration. https://wpengine.com/support/ssh-gateway/#addsshkey
